# tab

**This is my personal toy language, used for exploring concepts of programming language design.**

It is an indentation-based programming language characterized by minimal syntax and maximum flexibility.


Implementations are currently available in Golang and JavaScript.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jen-Ya/tab
cd tab
export TABHOME=`pwd`/tab

# Install Golang version (Golang must be already installed):
./bin/tabgo-install
# Run Golang tests
tabgo ./tab/tabgo/test-all.tab

# Run JavaScipt tests (NodeJS must be already installed):
node ./bin/tab ./tab/test-all.tab
```

You can optionally add the following line to your shell startup script (such as .bash_profile or .zshrc). Remember to substitute /path/to/tab with the actual path, paying attention to the double /tab/tab in TABHOME.

```sh
export TABHOME="/path/to/tab/tab"
export PATH="/path/to/tab/bin:${PATH}"
```

## Examples

### Comments

```
# Single line comment

#
	multiline
	comment
#

#
	# nested comments are okay #
	this # is also okay, multiline-comments are tokenized based on indentation
#

#
	this
is not allowed!
#
```

### Numbers and Strings

```
# Numbers always start with a digit or a minus and have arbitrary length and precision

2.2123123
2
0.1
-0.4

# Strings are either single or multi-line and are enclosed with ' or "

'string'
"string\nwith\nlinebreaks"

# multiline strings are stripped based on indentation

"
	multi
	line
		string
"

# is equal to "multiline\nline\n\tstring", with only one tab in the last line
```

### Indentation, parentheses

```
# A single identifier is treated as its value:

hello

# An identifier followed by something in the same line is treated as an lisp-style s-expression

print "hello"

# Indented arguments and parenthesis

print
	"the answer to everyhing is"
	* 21 2

print "the answer to everything is" (* 21 2)

```


### Fibonacci
```
fn fibo x
	if (< x 2) 1
		+
			fibo (- x 1)
			fibo (- x 2)
```

## Golang implementation

The source is in the `./go` directory.

The Implementation supports extensions written in go. You can find examples in `./tab/tabgo/plugins`.

## NodeJS implementation

The source is in the `./js` directory.

### Inline comments?

might look like this, but it might not always be clear where the comment starts and ends

```
# inline comment # print "test"

#( you could indicate start and end with parens, but should the tokenizer be aware of it? Thinking of documentation generation etc. )#
```

## JS implementation

First implementation based on [mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).

### TABHOME env variable

For file imports to work, TABHOME environment variable must be set and point to this projects' tab **subfolder**.

Put that in your .bash_profile or whatever:

`export TABHOME='/path/to/tab/tab'`

To make tab command available everywhere in your shell add

`export PATH="path/to/tab/bin:${PATH}"`

try ```node bin/tab ./tab/hello.tab```
